Problem: Speaker Recognition using time domain approach: 
Record vowel 'a' as in "mask" or "bat" from at least one male and one female speaker. Use sampling rate of 8 kHz. Use 30 ms of vowel 'a' portion from each utterance. Plot autocorrelation of vowel part of the signals. Measure the difference between two peaks of the autocorrelation function. Measure fundamental frequency of the speaker as reciprocal of that difference.
